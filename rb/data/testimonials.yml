      say: Working with this team has been such a pleasure. They provided hours of dedication to turn our old buggy database into an amazing and useful tool. We explained our vision and they came up with a way to implement it. They were also always available to answer questions no matter what time of day or night.

    - name: Jonathon Morgan, SATrails
      say: ThoughtNirvana are a team of dedicated, professional engineers who adapted to our development workflow and contributed across the stack -- from our front-end JavaScript through a scripted deployment (that's still how we move code into production!).

      say: Working with ThoughtNirvana was a pleasure.  Their team was an extension of our in house technical team, working together to develop and deliver on time. Their strength stems from their availability, the turnaround time, and most importantly, their technical skills. I highly recommend their service.

      say: It is no secret that working with remote contractors has its challenges. But having worked with Rahul and Ujjawal of ThoughtNirvana as technical lead and fellow developer, I can highly recommend them as a solid outsourcing solution.  Their level of cooperation, professionalism, skill,and availability despite the time-difference was refreshing.  It was truly a pleasure working with these guys for a few years, and I hope circumstances will allow us to work with them again.
